Namelist(default).input corresponds to the default scheme for running WRF. Similarly, Namelist(improved).input is for the improved scheme. 
Both files must be renamed to namelist.input before running WRF. 

module_sf_mynn.F and module_bl_mynn.F contain the code for the improved scheme. 
You can use VSCode, a software tool, to compare these files with the default versions in WRF 4.1.3.
